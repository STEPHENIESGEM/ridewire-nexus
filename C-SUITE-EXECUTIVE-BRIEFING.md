## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: AI Model Hallucination (High Impact)**
- **Problem:** AI agents provide incorrect diagnostics
- **Probability:** 10% (mitigated by consensus + safety gating)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - 70% consensus threshold (2/3 agreement required)
  - Safety keyword blacklist (15+ unsafe patterns)
  - Human escalation for edge cases (<10% of diagnostics)
  - User feedback loop (report incorrect diagnostics)
- **Insurance:** Liability coverage ($2M policy) for AI recommendations

**Risk 2: Platform Downtime (Medium Impact)**
- **Problem:** Database failure or API outage
- **Probability:** 0.1% (99.9% uptime target)
- **Mitigation:**
  - AWS multi-AZ deployment (redundant servers)
  - Database read replicas (1 primary + 2 replicas)
  - Auto-scaling load balancers
  - Automated failover (< 1 minute recovery time)
- **Monitoring:** PagerDuty 24/7 alerts, CloudWatch metrics

**Risk 3: Data Breach (Critical Impact)**
- **Problem:** User data or payment info compromised
- **Probability:** <1% (industry standard)
- **Mitigation:**
  - AES-256 encryption for all messages
  - Stripe handles payment processing (PCI compliant)
  - No credit card data stored on our servers
  - Regular security audits (quarterly)
  - Bug bounty program ($500-$5,000 rewards)
- **Response Plan:** Immediate user notification, forensic analysis, regulatory compliance

### Business Risks

**Risk 4: Slow User Adoption (High Impact)**
- **Problem:** Fail to reach 1,000 users in Month 1
- **Probability:** 30%
- **Mitigation:**
  - Diversified acquisition channels (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, influencers)
  - Aggressive pricing ($29/month, free tier)
  - Product Hunt launch (guaranteed 100+ users)
  - Referral program (10% commission on subscriptions)
- **Pivot:** If B2C slow, pivot to B2B (auto shops, fleet management)

**Risk 5: Competitor Entry (Medium Impact)**
- **Problem:** Google/Microsoft launch competing AI diagnostic tool
- **Probability:** 40% (large tech companies exploring auto space)
- **Mitigation:**
  - First-mover advantage (build moat with 100K users)
  - Multi-AI differentiation (consensus vs. single AI)
  - Marketplace network effects (creators locked in)
  - Patent filing for consensus algorithm (Q1 2026)
- **Strategy:** Position as acquisition target ($100M+ valuation)
