```

**Post Template 2 (Lessons Learned):**
```
Title: Built $5M in AI tech, made $0 revenue – here's what I learned

Body:
6 months. Production-ready platform. Multiple revenue streams identified. Zero actual revenue.

Here's where I went wrong:
1. Built product before finding customers ✗
2. Assumed "build it and they will come" ✗
3. Focused on perfection instead of MVP ✗
4. Didn't validate pricing early ✗
5. Underestimated importance of sales/marketing ✗

What went right:
1. Technology is solid ✓
2. Multiple use cases validated ✓
3. Got incredible learning experience ✓

What I'm doing now:
Selling/licensing the tech to people who can actually monetize it.

Available assets: [list]
Pricing: $25K-$500K depending on scope

If you're building with AI, learn from my mistakes. Don't be me.

Questions welcome.
