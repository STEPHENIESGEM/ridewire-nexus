# TikTok Outreach Templates

## Overview
TikTok outreach requires a different approach than YouTube/Twitter. Communication is typically via:
1. **Direct Messages (DMs)** on TikTok app
2. **Email** (business inquiry address in bio)
3. **Instagram DM** (many TikTokers link Instagram)
4. **Comments on videos** (initial engagement before DM)
