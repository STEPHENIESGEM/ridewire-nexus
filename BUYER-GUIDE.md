## 📧 Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: Auto Shop Owner (Tracy's Network)

**Subject:** AI saved my shop 20 hours last week – want to see how?

Hi [First Name],

My name is Tracy, and I've been a mechanic for [X years]. Last month, I helped build an AI system that changed everything about how I run my shop.

Here's what it does:
- Answers customer calls 24/7 (no more missed appointments)
- Helps diagnose tough issues in seconds
- Schedules appointments automatically
- Sends reminders so customers actually show up

**The result?** I'm spending 20+ hours less on admin and phone calls, and more time turning wrenches (which is what I actually get paid for).

Setup takes 48 hours. Cost is $5K upfront + $500/month. Most shops see ROI in 30 days.

Want to see a 15-minute demo? I'll show you exactly how it works in your shop.

Reply "SHOW ME" and I'll send you a link to book a time that works for you.

Best,  
Tracy  
[Phone Number]

P.S. - If you know other shop owners who'd benefit, I'm happy to demo for them too. I'll throw in a $500 referral bonus for every shop that signs up.

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because RideWire AI Hub has a solution that could significantly improve operations across [Company Name]'s service departments.

A production-ready AI orchestration engine that combines ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for consensus-based recommendations. Includes safety gating, audit logs, and compliance features.

### Template 5: OBD-II Scanner Manufacturer

**Subject:** Add AI diagnostics to your scanners – 30-day integration

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because we've built an AI diagnostic engine that could differentiate [Company Name]'s scanners from competitors.

- White-label (your brand, not ours)
- 30-day integration timeline

**Business model options:**
1. **Royalty:** $10 per scanner sold (preferred)

3. **Rev share:** $50K + 30% of premium tier upgrades

**Why now?**
- BlueDriver and Autel are exploring AI integrations
- First-mover advantage in your price segment
- Consumer demand for "smart" diagnostic tools growing

Would you be open to a technical demo with your engineering team? I can show the API in action and walk through integration requirements.

### Reddit Post Template 2: r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Made $0 in 6 months building an AI startup – here's what I learned (and what I'm selling)

Built an entire AI platform for automotive diagnostics. Zero revenue after 6 months. Here's why and what I'm doing about it.

**What went wrong:**
1. Built product before finding customers ✗
2. Focused on perfection instead of MVP ✗
3. Didn't validate market demand enough ✗

**What went right:**
1. Created legitimately valuable technology ✓
2. All code is production-ready ✓
3. Multiple use cases beyond automotive ✓

**What I'm doing now:**
Selling/licensing the technology to people who can actually monetize it.

**Available assets:**
- Multi-AI engine (combine ChatGPT + Claude + Gemini)
- Safety gating system (prevent AI errors)
- AR diagnostic templates
- E-commerce automation
- Complete white-label platform

**Pricing:**

**Why buy from me?**
- You get finished product, not vaporware
- Save 6-12 months of development
- I'm desperate, so you get a great deal

If you're building anything with AI, DM me. Let's talk.

P.S. - Not asking for advice on "how to pivot" or "keep grinding." I need revenue, not motivation. Thanks.

## 📞 Cold Calling Script

**For Auto Shop Owners (Tracy's Network)**

---

**Opening:**
"Hi [First Name], this is Tracy. I'm a mechanic over at [Location]. Do you have 2 minutes? I want to tell you about something that's saved me 20 hours a week."

**If Yes:**
"Great. So here's the deal – I helped build an AI system that handles all the annoying parts of running a shop. Customer calls, scheduling, even helping with diagnostics."

**Pause for reaction**

"The AI answers calls 24/7, so you never miss an appointment. It can look at P-codes and suggest fixes in real-time. And it schedules everything automatically."

**Value Prop:**
"Most shops I've shown this to save 15-20 hours a week on admin stuff. That's time you can spend actually working on cars or going home early."

**Pricing:**
"Setup is $5,000 and it's $500 a month after that. Most shops break even in 30 days when they factor in the time savings."

**Close:**
"I'd love to show you a quick demo – takes about 15 minutes. Are you free [Day/Time] or would [Alternative Day/Time] work better?"

**If Objection – "Too expensive":**
"I get it. But think about it this way – if you're billing $100/hour, and this saves you 20 hours a week, that's $2,000 in labor value. Every week."

**If Objection – "Not tech-savvy":**
"That's exactly why we built it simple. If you can use a smartphone, you can use this. And I'll be there to help you set it up."

**If Objection – "Need to think about it":**
"Totally fair. How about I send you a video of it in action? You can watch it when you have time and let me know if you want to see more."

## 🎬 YouTube Video Script (5-Minute Pitch)

**Title:** "I Built an AI Platform That Replaced 30 Employees – Here's How"

---

**[0:00-0:15] Hook:**
*Camera on founder, casual setting*

"I'm going to show you how I built an AI system that does the work of 30 people for less than $1,000 a month. And then I'm going to tell you why I'm selling it."

**[0:15-1:00] Problem:**
"Six months ago, I was facing a problem that every startup faces: I needed to build a company but I had no money to hire people.

Traditional approach? Raise venture capital, hire a team, burn cash for 18 months.

My approach? Build an AI workforce instead."

**[1:00-2:30] Solution:**
*Screen recording of the platform*

"This is RideWire AI Hub. It orchestrates multiple AI agents to work together.

Watch this: I'm going to ask it to diagnose a car problem.

*Demo: Ask diagnostic question*

See that? Three different AI engines – ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini – all analyzing the same question. Then they reach consensus.

This prevents any single AI from giving a wrong answer. It's like having three mechanics look at the same problem."

**[2:30-3:30] Proof:**
*Showing code, documentation*

"Here's the actual code. Production-ready. Tested. Documented.

This isn't vaporware or a Figma mockup. This is real software that works right now.

It's handling customer service, diagnostics, content generation, and more."

**[3:30-4:30] Why I'm Selling:**
"So why am I selling this instead of scaling it?

Brutal honesty: I'm a builder, not a salesperson. I built incredible technology, but I struggled with go-to-market.

I'd rather sell this to someone who can monetize it properly than watch it sit idle while I learn marketing for 2 years.

Plus, I need liquidity. I'm supporting 8 people right now and it's winter in Albuquerque."

**[4:30-5:00] Call to Action:**
"If you're interested in buying, licensing, or partnering, email me at hello@stepheniesgem.io

Pricing ranges from $25,000 for a white-label license up to $500,000 for exclusive rights to the whole platform.

First 3 buyers get 50% off. No negotiation.

## 💰 Negotiation Framework

### When Buyer Says "Too Expensive"

**Option 1: Payment Plan**
"I understand. Would it help if we broke it into payments?
- 50% upfront
- 25% at 30 days
- 25% at 60 days"

**Option 2: Reduced Scope**
"What if we started with [Smaller Package]? That's $X,XXX and includes [Core Features]. You can always upgrade later."

**Option 3: ROI Focus**
"Let's walk through the ROI. Based on [their metrics], you'd break even in [timeframe]. After that, it's pure profit."

**Option 4: Fire Sale**
"We're running a promotion right now – 50% off for the first 3 buyers. That brings it down to $X,XXX. But it expires [Date]."

### When Buyer Says "Need to Think About It"

**Option 1: Time Pressure**
"Totally fair. Just so you know, we have 2 other buyers looking at this asset. I'm doing first-come-first-served, so if you're interested, let me know by [Date]."

**Option 2: Risk Reversal**
"How about this: Do the demo, and if you don't see value, no hard feelings. But if you do see value, let's talk about next steps."

**Option 3: Address Concerns**
"Is there anything specific you're concerned about? Price? Integration? ROI? Let's talk through it."

### When Buyer Says "Can You Do Better on Price?"

**Option 1: Bundle Discount**
"If you're interested in multiple assets, I can bundle them at a discount. Which other assets are you considering?"

**Option 2: Equity Swap**
"I'm open to creative structures. What if we did $X,XXX cash + Y% equity in your company?"

**Option 3: Rev Share**
"What if we did a lower upfront ($X,XXX) plus a revenue share (20%)? That way you pay more as you make more."

**Option 4: Final Offer**
"My absolute lowest is $X,XXX. That includes everything – code, support, documentation. But I need a decision by [Date]."

---

## 🚨 Urgency Tactics (Use Sparingly)

### Tactic 1: Limited Quantity
"I'm only licensing this to 3 companies per industry vertical to avoid direct competition. I already have 1 automotive buyer, so there are 2 spots left."

### Tactic 2: Other Buyer Interest
"Just FYI, I have another buyer looking at this same asset. They're doing due diligence now. I'm doing first-come-first-served on payments, so whoever wires money first gets it."

### Tactic 3: Price Increase
"Current price is $X,XXX until [Date]. After that, it goes up to $Y,YYY. Just want to give you a heads up."

### Tactic 4: Founder Liquidity
"To be transparent, I need liquidity this week to support my team. If you can close by [Date], I'll throw in [Bonus] at no extra charge."

---

**Remember:** Be ethical. Don't lie. But do create genuine urgency when it exists.
