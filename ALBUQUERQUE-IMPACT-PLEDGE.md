## 🔑 The Ownership Model

### Why Ownership Matters:

**Traditional Model:**
- Homeless → Shelter → Subsidized rent
- Never own anything
- Always vulnerable

**RideWire Model:**
- Homeless → Home → Ownership → Wealth
- Build equity
- Generational impact

### Rent-to-Own Structure:

**Option 1: 5-Year Pathway to Ownership**

Year 1:
- Move in: $0 down payment
- Pay: $400/month
- Goes toward: Ownership equity (100%)

Year 2-4:
- Continue: $400/month
- Total paid: $400 × 48 months = $19,200
- Equity built: $19,200

Year 5:
- Final payment: $0 (fully paid through rent)
- Title transfers to resident
- They OWN the home

**Total Cost to Resident:** $24,000 over 5 years
**Market Value:** $70,000
**Equity Gained:** $46,000 (instant wealth)

**Option 2: Shared Equity Forever**

- RideWire owns 50%, resident owns 50%
- Resident pays: $200/month (ultra-affordable)
- When they sell: Split proceeds 50/50
- Capital recycles to help more families

**Example:**
- House value: $70,000
- They sell for: $100,000 (after 10 years)
- RideWire gets: $50,000 (reinvest in 1 new home)
- Resident gets: $50,000 (life-changing cash)
- Everyone wins
