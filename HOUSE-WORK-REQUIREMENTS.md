# 🏠 Roommate Chore Rotation & Equity Gift

## The Deal

**Extended family members may receive equity as a GIFT from Stephanie for being good roommates during the founding period (6-12 months).**

### Basic Expectations:
- **Clean up after yourself**
- **Do your share of house chores** (rotating schedule)
- **Don't trash shared spaces**
- **Don't eat all the food without replacing**
- **Be respectful to everyone**
- **Help when asked occasionally**

**That's it. Normal roommate stuff.**

### What You Get:
- **Free housing:** Worth $500-1,000/month
- **Free food:** Worth $300-500/month  
- **Support getting on your feet**
- **OPTIONAL GIFT if you're a good roommate:** $304K-$9.12M equity at $800M exit
