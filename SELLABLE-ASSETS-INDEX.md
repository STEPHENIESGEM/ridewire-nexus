## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small:** Don't try to execute everything at once. Pick one channel and master it.

2. **Personalize Everything:** Generic outreach gets ignored. Spend 2 minutes researching each prospect.

3. **Follow Up Relentlessly:** Most deals happen after 5-7 touchpoints. Don't give up after one email.

4. **Use Urgency Ethically:** The fire sale is real. The need for liquidity is real. Use it.

5. **Track Everything:** You can't improve what you don't measure.

6. **Ask for Referrals:** Every conversation should end with "Do you know anyone else who might be interested?"

7. **Demo Often:** Demos convert 10x better than emails. Get face time.

8. **Be Honest:** About struggles, about urgency, about what's for sale. Honesty builds trust.

9. **Price Confidently:** These assets are worth what they're priced at. Don't apologize.

10. **Take Action:** Perfect is the enemy of done. Send that first email NOW.
