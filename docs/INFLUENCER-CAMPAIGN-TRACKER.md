Hi [Influencer Name],

I'm [Your Name] from RideWire AI Hub, and I've been a fan of [their channel/content] for a while. Your recent video on [specific topic] was spot-on.

We've built something I think your audience would love: an AI-powered diagnostic platform that combines ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to give mechanics instant, accurate diagnoses. Plus, AR overlays that show exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

Think "Iron Man's garage" but for everyday shops.

We're looking for automotive creators to partner with and we'd love to work with you. Here's what we're offering:

✅ Early platform access (free Pro account)
✅ Exclusive affiliate partnership (30% commission on all referrals)
✅ [Optional: $X flat fee for dedicated content]

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

Here's a quick demo: [Link to 60-second demo video]

Hi [Influencer Name],

I'm [Your Name] from RideWire, and I've been following [their channel] since [specific reference].

We've built a multi-AI diagnostic platform that I think would be a great fit for your audience. It's AR + AI + automotive diagnostics - basically using GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini simultaneously to diagnose car problems in seconds.

The UX feels like Iron Man's HUD, but for mechanics. I think it's a perfect example of AI actually solving real-world problems (not just generating blog posts).

Would you be interested in checking it out? I'd love to send you a demo account and get your thoughts.

Quick demo video: [Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 3 Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Re: Partnership Opportunity - RideWire AI Hub

Hi [Name],

Just checking if you saw my email about RideWire? I know you're busy, but I think your audience would genuinely love this.

Quick recap: AI diagnostic platform + AR overlays = future of auto repair.

Here's the demo again: [Link]

Let me know if you're interested!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 7 Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Free Pro Account for [Influencer Name]

Hi [Name],

I'd love to send you a free RideWire Pro account ($29/month value) so you can try it out yourself. No strings attached - just curious to get your feedback.

If you like it and want to share with your audience, we can talk partnership terms. But even if not, I'd value your input.

Interested?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 14 Final Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Last call - RideWire demo

Hi [Name],

This is my last follow-up - I know you're swamped with opportunities.

Here's a 60-second demo showing RideWire in action: [Link]

If it's not a fit, no worries at all. Just wanted to make sure you saw it.
