## PRICING PSYCHOLOGY TACTICS

### Charm Pricing
- ✅ Use: $19.99, $49.99, $79.99 (appears cheaper)
- ❌ Avoid: $20, $50, $80 (round numbers feel more expensive)

### Anchoring
- Show original "value" price crossed out
- Example: ~~$149~~ **$79.99** (47% off!)
- Use "Save $XX" messaging prominently

### Tiered Pricing
- Always show 3 options minimum (good, better, best)
- Highlight middle tier as "most popular" (default choice)
- Make enterprise tier significantly more expensive (makes Pro feel affordable)

### Scarcity & Urgency
- "Limited time: 48 hours only"
- "Only 50 spots remaining"
- "Early bird ends soon"
- Countdown timers on sales pages

### Payment Plans
- Offer for products $200+
- Example: "$399 or 3 payments of $149"
- Reduces barrier to high-ticket purchases
