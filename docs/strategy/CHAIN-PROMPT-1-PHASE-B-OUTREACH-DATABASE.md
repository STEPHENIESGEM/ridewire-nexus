## OUTREACH SEQUENCING STRATEGY

### Week 1: Tier 1A Blitz (3 Targets)
1. **Day 1-2:** Secure warm introductions for all 3 Tier 1A targets
2. **Day 3-4:** Send initial outreach emails (Phase C scripts)
3. **Day 5-7:** Demo scheduling and follow-up calls

**Rationale:** Anthropic, Harley-Davidson, and Honda represent highest likelihood of close + fastest timelines. Anthropic and Harley have highest strategic alignment. Honda brings unmatched scale.

### Week 2: Tier 1B Parallel Track (4 Targets)
1. **Day 8-9:** Warm intro research for OpenAI, Indian/Polaris, Microsoft, Mitchell
2. **Day 10-11:** Initial outreach to all 4 targets
3. **Day 12-14:** Demo coordination and relationship building

**Rationale:** Keep momentum with strong secondary targets. OpenAI and Indian/Polaris have strong fit. Microsoft and Mitchell are strategic bets (platform leverage + defensive acquisition).

### Week 3+: Tier 1C Opportunistic (2 Targets)
1. **Day 15+:** Outreach to Google DeepMind and Cox Automotive
2. **Focus:** Relationship building, not urgent close
3. **Tactic:** Use Tier 1A/1B momentum as social proof

**Rationale:** Google and Cox are long-term strategic plays. Pursue if Tier 1A/1B conversations stall or to create competitive dynamic.
