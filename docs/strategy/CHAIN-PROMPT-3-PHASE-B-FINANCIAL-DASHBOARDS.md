## DASHBOARD 1: 5-YEAR PATHWAY TO $180M

**Key Metrics Display**:
- Year 1: $6.78M revenue → 200+ customers → $350K burn/month
- Year 2: $16.2M revenue → 400+ customers → Profitability in Q3
- Year 3: $36.35M revenue → 800+ customers → 38% operating margin
- Year 4: $80.7M revenue → 1,500+ customers → 42% operating margin
- Year 5: $150M revenue → 2,500+ customers → $60M+ net income

**Interactive Levers**:
- Adjust SaaS pricing elasticity (-20% to +20%)
- Modify customer acquisition timeline (accelerate/decelerate)
- Toggle marketplace revenue scenarios
- Model Series B at different valuations

## DASHBOARD 2: UNIT ECONOMICS DEEP-DIVE

**Real-Time Calculations**:
- CAC Payback Period by Tier (Professional: 18 months, Enterprise: 14 months)
- LTV:CAC Ratio dynamics (12:1 to 32:1)
- Gross Margin by Revenue Stream (78% SaaS, 65% Services, 85% Marketplace)
- NRR Trajectory (105% → 125% by Year 3)

**Scenario Toggles**:
- Best case: +20% pricing power
- Base case: Current assumptions
- Downside: -30% customer acquisition

## DASHBOARD 3: RUNWAY & BURN ANALYSIS

**Series A Funding Impact**:
- $8M raised → 28-month runway
- $10M raised → 32-month runway
- Breakeven milestone: Q3 Year 2
- Series B timing: Month 24 (at $90-120M valuation)

**Cash Flow Visibility**:
- Monthly burn rate 
- Customer LTV realization timing
- Working capital requirements

## DASHBOARD 4: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**Side-by-Side Comparison**:
- RideWire vs. Mitchell 1: Unit economics, TAM, GTM speed
- Market share projections (8-12% dealer networks by Year 5)
- Pricing power advantage (Premium positioning, not discount)

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**Tools & Frameworks**:
- Looker / Tableau for investor-facing dashboards
- Google Sheets for real-time model edits
- Plotly for interactive scenario modeling

**Demo Interactivity**:
- Live scenario modeling in investor meetings
- Change CAC assumption: Dashboard updates in real-time
- "What if" exercises (e.g., "What if we capture 3% SAM instead of 4%?")

**Phase B Status**: Financial dashboard architecture + scenario modeling framework ready for Phase C visual design and interactive demo preparation.
