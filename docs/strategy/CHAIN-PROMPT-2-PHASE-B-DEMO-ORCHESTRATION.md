## THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON DIAGNOSTIC DEMO (7-10 minutes)

### SCENE 1: Problem Injection (0:00-1:30)
**Narrator**: "A 2024 Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide comes into our pilot shop in Milwaukee with a check engine light."

**Live System State**:
- P0200: Fuel Pump Malfunction (Primary fault)
- Real-time vehicle telemetry displayed
- RideWire AI analyzing in parallel

**Investor Hook**: "Legacy diagnostic tools would send the technician to replace the fuel pump. Cost: $2,000. Labor: 8 hours. Our AI system sees something different."

### SCENE 2: AI Multi-System Analysis (1:30-4:00)
**Live Cascade Revealed**:
1. **P0305**: Cylinder 5 Misfire Detected
   - Root cause: Faulty fuel injector (not fuel pump)
   - Secondary flag: Cylinder 5 compression variance
2. **P0420**: Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold
   - Connected to P0305: Unburned fuel damaging O2 sensor
3. **P0087**: Fuel Rail Pressure Too Low
   - Upstream cause: Fuel filter partially blocked

**AI Reasoning Display** (on-screen):
```
[DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS]
Fault Cascade Detected: P0200 → P0305 → P0420 → P0087

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS: Fuel injector malfunction with secondary fuel delivery constraints
CONFIDENCE: 94.2% (based on vehicle telemetry + historical patterns)

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
1. Replace fuel injector (Cylinder 5) - $400
2. Replace fuel filter - $60
3. Clean O2 sensor or replace - $200
4. Clear fault codes and retest

TECHNICIAN TIME: 2 hours (vs. 8 hours for fuel pump replacement)
Parts Cost: $660 (vs. $2,000)
Customer Savings: $1,340
```

**Investor Value Proposition**: "In one transaction, we just saved this technician 6 hours of labor and saved the customer $1,340. This is repeated 20x per week per shop. For a 50-location chain: 1,000 diagnostic consultations per week × $1,000 average savings = $50M value creation annually."

### SCENE 3: Technician Workflow Integration (4:00-6:00)
**Live Demo**:
- Technician receives RideWire recommendation on mobile app
- Parts pre-ordered automatically
- Flat-rate estimate generated
- Customer notification sent (transparent pricing)

**NPS Impact**: "Our Harley pilot: Technician diagnostic accuracy up 34%. Customer satisfaction (NPS) improved from 62 to 78. Technician productivity +28%."

### SCENE 4: Business Impact (6:00-7:30)
**Financial Overlay**:
- Monthly recurring revenue: $5K-$10K per location
- Services revenue multiplier: $2-3x per SaaS subscription
- Marketplace revenue: Additional $500-$1K/month per location

**Talk Track**: "This is why we're building a $450M TAM SaaS business that only exists because AI solved a 40-year-old problem in automotive repair."

### SCENE 5: OEM Partnership Angle (7:30-9:00 [optional, 5 min version])
**Use Case for OEM Decision-Makers**:
- Warranty compliance: Every claim validated by AI before payment
- Predictive diagnostics: Warranty cost reduction of 15-20%
- Customer retention: Direct consumer connection via warranty programs
- Data asset: OEMs gain telemetry on field failures

**OEM Positioning**: "We're the diagnostic layer that OEMs have been waiting for. Harley-Davidson could use us to differentiate warranty experiences. Opportunity: $15M+ deal."

## TECHNICAL CREDIBILITY ELEMENTS

**During Every Demo**:
1. **Live vehicle telemetry**: Show real data (not pre-recorded)
2. **AI confidence scores**: Transparency on model certainty
3. **Competitive comparison**: How RideWire outperforms Mitchell 1 on same case
4. **Technician workflow**: Real mobile app UI (not mockup)
5. **Customer impact metrics**: Real NPS/ROI numbers from pilot

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Pre-recorded demos
- ❌ Generic industry examples
- ❌ Vague AI claims (always show the math)
- ❌ Slides without live interaction
- ❌ Disconnects between demo narrative and financial model
