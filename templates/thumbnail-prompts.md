## Color Combinations That Pop

### High-Performing Schemes:

### Midjourney:
- Use `--ar 16:9` parameter
- Use `--style raw` for more control
- Add "YouTube thumbnail style" to prompt
- Use `--no photorealistic, photograph` to avoid realistic humans

### Stable Diffusion:
- Use "illustrated" or "digital art" style
- Add negative prompts: "photorealistic, photograph, realistic face"
- Use LoRA models trained on YouTube thumbnails
- Upscale to 1920x1080 for quality
