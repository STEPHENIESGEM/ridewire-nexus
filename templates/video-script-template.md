## Script Structure

### 1. INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)
**HOOK:** Start with one of COCO's catchphrases
- "Hey wrenchers!"
- "Let's fix this together"
- "Time to get your hands dirty"

**OPEN WITH:**
- Immediate problem statement or question
- Relatable scenario
- Bold claim or surprising fact

**EXAMPLE:**
> "Hey wrenchers! Today we're tackling the P0300 misfire code that's been driving you crazy. I'm COCO, your AI mechanic powered by RideWire, and we're about to use THREE different AI systems to diagnose this problem. Buckle up!"

---

### 2. PROBLEM OVERVIEW (0:30 - 2:00)
**EXPLAIN:**
- What is the issue?
- Why does it matter?
- Common symptoms users experience
- Impact on vehicle performance

**COCO'S STYLE:**
- Be direct and technical
- Add slight sarcasm ("Oh, your 'check engine light' is on again? Shocking.")
- Make it relatable
- Use mechanic slang appropriately

**EXAMPLE:**
> "So you've got a P0300 code. That means your engine's misfiring randomly—not just one cylinder, but it's playing whack-a-mole with your spark plugs. Could be ignition, could be fuel, could be that time you tried to fix it yourself with YouTube videos from 2007. Let's find out."

---

### 3. RIDEWIRE MULTI-AI DIAGNOSIS (2:00 - 5:00)
**DEMONSTRATE CONSENSUS:**
- Show how ChatGPT analyzes the problem
- Show Claude's deep reasoning
- Show Gemini's perspective
- Highlight where they agree (consensus)
- Discuss where they differ (interesting!)

**STRUCTURE:**
```
ChatGPT says: [diagnosis]
Claude thinks: [diagnosis]
Gemini suggests: [diagnosis]

CONSENSUS: [agreed solution]
DISAGREEMENTS: [alternative theories]
```

**COCO'S COMMENTARY:**
- "Now here's where it gets interesting..."
- "All three AIs are screaming at us about [common point]"
- "Notice how Claude went deeper into [technical detail]"
- "This is why we use multi-AI consensus—one AI might miss something"

**EXAMPLE:**
> "I plugged this into RideWire's AI Hub. ChatGPT immediately flagged spark plugs and coils—classic move. Claude dug deeper and pointed out the fuel injector pattern. Gemini brought up something both missed: the crankshaft position sensor. But here's the kicker—all three agreed on checking the spark plugs FIRST. That's your consensus, wrenchers."

---

### 4. SOLUTION & ACTION STEPS (5:00 - 7:00)
**PROVIDE CLEAR STEPS:**
1. **First Step:** What to check/test
2. **Second Step:** How to diagnose further
3. **Third Step:** Repair or replacement procedure
4. **Cost Estimate:** Realistic pricing

**SAFETY DISCLAIMERS:**
- "Disconnect the battery first"
- "Let the engine cool down"
- "Use proper safety equipment"

**COCO'S TIPS:**
- "Pro tip: [insider knowledge]"
- "Don't skip this step or you'll regret it"
- "This is where most DIYers mess up"

**EXAMPLE:**
> "Here's what you're gonna do:
> Step 1: Pull those spark plugs. If they look like they've been through a war, replace 'em.
> Step 2: Check the coil packs with a multimeter—we're looking for consistent resistance.
> Step 3: If those check out, move to fuel pressure testing.
> 
> Cost breakdown: Spark plugs $30-60, coils $50-150 each, labor if you're lazy $200-400. But you're not lazy, right?"
