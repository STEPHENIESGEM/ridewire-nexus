# Wicked Problems Workshop – Rapid AI Solution Development

**Transform Impossible Challenges Into Deployed Solutions in 24-48 Hours**

---

## 🎯 What Is the Wicked Problems Workshop?

A **Wicked Problems Workshop** is an intensive, hands-on consulting engagement where we tackle your most challenging business problems using AI and deliver working prototypes in as little as 24-48 hours.

Led by a proven AI architect who built a 7-agent workforce that replaced 30 employees and saved $3.3M/year in costs.

## 🔥 What Makes It "Wicked"?

**Wicked Problems** are challenges that seem impossible to solve with traditional approaches:

✓ Too complex for standard solutions  
✓ Time-sensitive (need answers NOW, not in 6 months)  
✓ Unclear requirements (you know there's a problem but not exactly what it is)  
✓ High stakes (significant revenue/cost impact)  
✓ Resistance to change (internal stakeholders don't agree)

**Examples of Wicked Problems:**
- "We're losing $100K/month but can't figure out where"
- "Our customer churn is 40% and we don't know why"
- "We need to reduce costs by 30% without layoffs"
- "We have 6 months of runway and need revenue yesterday"
- "Our competitors are using AI and we have no idea where to start"
