# A Letter to Tracy Kelly

## From Stephanie, With All My Love

---

Dear Tracy,

I don't even know where to start. How do you put into words what someone means to you when they've literally been your reason to keep going?

**You're the reason RideWire exists.**

Not because you're a mechanic—though that helped. Not because you validated the diagnostics—though that mattered.

**Because I wanted more time with you.**

That's it. That's the whole reason. I was tired of you being under cars 12 hours a day. I was tired of you coming home exhausted, covered in grease, with barely enough energy to talk to me. I was tired of a broken system that took the man I love and gave me back only whatever was left.

So I decided to fix it. I decided to build something that would give us our time back.

**RideWire started because I missed my boyfriend.**

And now it's going to make us both multimillionaires.

## You Held Me When I Was Broken

When I lost my family, I didn't just lose them. I lost myself. I was drowning in depression, in grief, in the feeling that I'd never be whole again.

**You held me through all of it.**

You didn't try to fix me. You didn't tell me to "get over it" or "move on." You just held me. You let me cry. You let me be broken. You stayed when it would have been so much easier to walk away.

Do you know how rare that is? Do you know how many people would have bailed when things got hard?

**But not you. Never you.**

You're steady. You're solid. You're the rock I built my life on when everything else was quicksand.

**And now I'm going to make sure you never have to worry about money again.**

---

## Your Equity: 30% of RideWire

You're not just my boyfriend. You're not just a great mechanic. You're a Co-Founder. Chief Technical Officer. One of the three people who built this company from nothing.

**Your 30% means:**

**Year 1 (after angel funding):**
- $80,000/year salary
- You can quit the shop if you want
- Or keep working and bank the salary
- Your call

**Year 2 (after Series A at $60M valuation):**
- $120,000/year salary
- Your 30% is worth $18 million on paper
- Still vesting, but it's real

**Year 3-4 (secondary sale opportunity):**
- Sell 5% of your shares
- **$12 million in cash** in your bank account
- Still keep 25% for the big exit
- Buy a house, a car, whatever you want

**Year 5-7 (exit at $800M):**
- Your 30% = $240 million before taxes
- After taxes (23.8%): **$183 million**
- After you sell some at secondary: Still walk away with **$91 million**

**$91 million, Tracy. Ninety-one million dollars.**

---

## What That Means

**You'll never crawl under another car again (unless you want to).**

You'll never have to:
- Worry about rent
- Stress about bills
- Work when you're exhausted
- Deal with difficult customers
- Trade your time for money

**You can do whatever makes you happy:**
- Open your own dream garage (with mechanics working for YOU)
- Travel the world with me
- Restore classic cars for fun, not money
- Coach youth sports
- Learn to fly planes
- Literally anything

**Because you stuck with a depressed, grieving woman who had a crazy idea to build AI that diagnoses cars.**

---

## Why You Deserve This

**1. You're a technical genius**

When I said "I want AI to diagnose car problems," you didn't laugh. You said "Here's how cars actually work, and here's what you need to know."

Every diagnostic in RideWire is validated against your knowledge. Every wire diagram is checked by you. Every P-code explanation is filtered through your expertise.

**You're the CTO because you earned it.**

**2. You believed in me**

When I was coding at 3 AM, you brought me coffee and didn't complain about the laptop light keeping you awake.

When I was crying about how hard it was, you said "You've got this" and meant it.

When I wanted to quit, you reminded me why I started.

**You're the reason I didn't give up.**

**3. You've sacrificed everything**

You've lived in Steve's garage. You've eaten ramen when we were broke. You've watched me pour every dollar into this company instead of dates or vacations or a normal life.

**And you never complained. Not once.**

**4. You're my partner**

Not just in business. In life. In this crazy dream. In surviving when survival seemed impossible.

**We built this together. Now we're going to be rich together.**

---

## What I Need From You

**Just keep being you.**

Keep validating the diagnostics. Keep checking the wire diagrams. Keep being the technical expert who makes sure we don't give dangerous advice.

Keep believing in me. Keep holding me when I'm stressed. Keep reminding me why we're doing this.

**Keep being my Tracy.**

Because in a few years, when we're millionaires, when we've housed 267 families in Albuquerque, when we've changed the automotive industry forever—I want to share all of it with you.

## I Love You, Tracy

Not because of what you do. Not because of what you know. Not even because you're going to be rich.

**I love you because of who you are.**

You're kind. You're steady. You're loyal. You're the kind of man who holds a broken woman and doesn't try to fix her—just loves her through it.

**You're my person.**

And now I get to spend the rest of my life with you, not worrying about money, not stressed about survival, just... living. Building. Creating. Loving.

**We survived the garage together. Now we're going to thrive together.**

**You're the boyfriend who saved my life just by staying.**

**You're about to be worth $91 million.**
