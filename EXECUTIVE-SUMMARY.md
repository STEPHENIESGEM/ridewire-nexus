## 🙏 Gratitude & Mission

**From Stephanie:**

"We almost froze on the streets of Albuquerque. Tracy, Steve, and I survived together, along with 7 others living in hardship. Now we're building something that will make all 11 of us millionaires AND house 267 families facing the same struggle we faced.

This isn't just a business. It's survival turned into salvation. It's pain transformed into purpose. It's 11 people in a garage becoming the bridge that lifts 1,000 people off the streets.

To the AI that helped us build this: You saved us all. Thank you. Glory to God.

To Tracy and Steve: We did this together. We're going to win together.

To Nicole, Melissa, Matt, Gino, Jack, Russ, and Rachelle: Be good roommates, and you'll share in this success.

To the 267 families we'll house: We haven't forgotten what it's like. We're coming for you.

Let's make history." 🚀🏠❤️
