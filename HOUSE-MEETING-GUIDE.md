## 📋 What to Say (Your Intro)

> "Hey everyone, can we all sit down for about 20 minutes? I want to talk about something really important.
> 
> First, I just want to say thank you. We've been through absolute hell together, and you all saved my life. Without this house, without all of you, I would be dead or on the streets.
> 
> But now I want to talk about our future. I've been building something called RideWire, and it's not just my company – it's OUR company. Every person in this house who's helped us survive can become a millionaire if we do this right.
> 
> I made a presentation to explain everything – the opportunity, what everyone gets, what the timeline is, and what I need from each of you. Let me show you."

## 🎯 Key Messages to Emphasize

### 1. This is REAL
- 37,000+ lines of working code
- Real market ($800B auto industry)
- Proven tech (AI is real, we're just combining 3 of them)
- Case studies of similar success (mention Sarah Chen example)

### 2. Everyone Benefits
- Not just Tracy, Steve, and me
- ALL 11 people can become millionaires
- Amounts range from $607K to $121M
- Even "worst case" exits make everyone rich

### 3. The Condition is Fair
- Only asking for 6-12 more months
- You get paid monthly regardless
- Equity is the BONUS for staying
- Protects everyone (no one can "take the money and run")

### 4. Timeline is Doable
- This week: Prove we can make $2K
- Month 6: Angel funding, money for apartments
- Month 12: Everyone in own place, equity vests
- Year 7: $800M exit, everyone paid

### 5. Social Impact Matters

## ❓ Expected Questions & Your Answers

### "Is this legal?"
**Answer:** "Yes, we'll set up a Delaware C-Corp and issue proper stock options. Thousands of startups do this. It's completely standard."

### "What if I need to leave early?"
**Answer:** "If there's a real emergency – family illness, etc. – we can work something out. But if you just decide to bail because you're bored or found something else, then yes, you lose the equity. That's fair, right?"

### "What if the company doesn't sell for $800M?"
**Answer:** "Even at $100M, you still get $75K-600K. At $400M, you get $300K-2.4M. Any exit makes you money. $800M is the goal, but even half that is life-changing."

### "Do I have to invest money?"
**Answer:** "NO. Zero dollars. Your equity is earned by helping us survive these next 6-12 months. That's your 'investment' – your time and support."

### "When do I actually get paid?"
**Answer:** "Monthly income starts NOW and continues. The big equity payout happens when we sell the company in Year 5-7. Think of monthly income as surviving, equity as thriving."

### "Why should I believe this will work?"
**Answer:** "I get the skepticism. But look – we've already built the tech (37,000 lines of code). The market exists ($800B industry). AI is real (you see ChatGPT everywhere). We just need to execute. And even if we don't hit $800M, we'll hit SOMETHING, and everyone profits."
