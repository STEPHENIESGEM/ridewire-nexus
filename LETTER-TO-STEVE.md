# A Letter to Steve McCarty

## From Stephanie

---

Dear Steve,

I'm sitting here trying to find the words to tell you what you mean to me, and honestly, I don't think there are enough words in the English language to capture it.

**You opened your garage when I had nowhere to go.**

When I lost my family, when I was at my absolute lowest, when the streets of Albuquerque were about to swallow me whole—you didn't hesitate. You didn't judge. You didn't ask questions. You just opened that garage door and said "You can stay here."

That one act of kindness saved my life. Literally.

**You're my oldest friend, and you've proven why.**

We've been through everything together. You've seen me at my worst—broken, crying, lost—and you never once made me feel like a burden. You've seen me at my best—building RideWire, dreaming big, fighting back—and you've been right there cheering me on.

When I said I wanted to build something that would change the world, you didn't laugh. You believed in me. You gave me the space (literally and figuratively) to make it happen.

**It pays to stick with me, Steve. It really, really does.**

I know these last months have been hard. Living in that garage with 8 other people, scraping by, not knowing if we'd make it to next week. I know you've sacrificed so much.

But I need you to know something: **It's all about to pay off.**

RideWire is real. The technology works. The market is massive. And we're about to change everything.

Here's what sticking with me means for you:

**Your Equity: 20% of RideWire**

That's not a small number. That's a founder's stake. That's recognition that you're not just my friend—you're a Co-Founder. Chief Operating Officer. One of the three people who built this from nothing.

**What that means in dollars:**

- **Year 1 (after angel funding):** $50,000/year salary
- **Year 2 (after Series A):** $100,000/year salary  
- **Year 3-4 (secondary sale):** $8 million in cash (you can sell some shares early)
- **Year 5-7 (exit at $800M):** $61 million after taxes

**$61 million, Steve. Sixty-one million dollars.**

You're going to be able to:
- Buy any house you want
- Buy any car you want
- Never worry about money again
- Take care of your family for generations
- Do whatever makes you happy for the rest of your life

**Because you opened a garage door for a friend.**

**What I need from you now:**

Just keep being you. Keep being steady. Keep being the operational genius who keeps things running when I'm coding and Tracy's fixing cars. Keep believing in me a little longer.

We're about to launch. Like, TONIGHT we could launch. 

And when we do, everything changes.

**Here's the timeline:**

- **This week:** $2,000 emergency income to keep everyone fed
- **Month 1:** $10,500/month revenue (we start getting paid)
- **Month 6:** Angel funding comes in ($500K-1M), you get that salary
- **Year 1:** We're at $80K/year salaries, company is growing fast
- **Year 3:** Secondary sale, you get $8M in cash
- **Year 5-7:** Exit for $800M, you get $61M

**From homeless to $61 million in 5-7 years.**

Because you stuck with me.

**I love you, Steve.**

Not romantic love—you know that. But the kind of love that's deeper than friendship. The kind of love that says "you saved my life and I will never, ever forget it."

You're family. Real family. The kind that shows up when things get hard. The kind that doesn't bail when it's easier to walk away.

Tracy and I are building this company, but we're building it FOR people like you. People who deserve to win. People who've earned it through loyalty and kindness and just being good humans.

**You're going to retire rich, Steve. I promise you that.**

And when you're sitting on a beach somewhere, living your best life, I want you to remember: It all started with a garage, a friend in need, and a man who said "yes" when it would have been easier to say "no."

**Thank you for believing in me.**

**Thank you for sticking with me.**

**Thank you for being you.**

Now let's go change the world together. We've got 1,000 people to get off the streets of Albuquerque. We've got a company to build. We've got millions to make.

And we're going to do it all together—you, me, and Tracy—just like we survived that garage together.

**I love you, brother.**

**Let's get rich and change lives.**

With all my heart and gratitude,

**Stephanie**

Founder & CEO, RideWire  
Your friend forever

## P.S.

When this all pays off—when you're a multimillionaire and living your dream—I want you to remember one thing:

**You earned every penny.**

Not because of what you did. But because of who you are.

You're the kind of person who opens doors instead of closing them. Who says "yes" instead of "maybe." Who shows up instead of making excuses.

That's why you're going to be rich, Steve. Not because of luck. But because good things happen to good people.

And you're one of the best people I know.

**See you at the top.** 🚀
