## 🎯 TESTING PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

**1. Real-World Validation**
- Test in actual shop environment, not lab
- Use real motorcycles with real diagnostic needs
- Involve actual technicians, not engineers
- Capture genuine workflow and challenges

**2. Collaborative Approach**
- Indian Motorcycle as partner, not just test site
- Technician feedback drives product development
- Transparent sharing of results (good and bad)
- Mutual learning and improvement

**3. Phased and Methodical**
- Start small, scale gradually
- Validate each phase before expanding
- Clear success criteria for each phase
- Flexibility to adjust based on learnings

**4. Data-Driven Decisions**
- Measure everything objectively
- Qualitative feedback + quantitative metrics
- Document successes AND failures
- Use data to guide development priorities
