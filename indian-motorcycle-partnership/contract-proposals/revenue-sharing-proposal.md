# Revenue Sharing Proposal

## Model Structure
**15% of Indian Network Revenue** to Indian Motorcycle

## Calculation Example
- 300 dealers × $299/month average = $89,700/month = $1,076,400/year
- Indian Motorcycle receives: $161,460/year (15%)

## Scaling Potential
- Year 1: 100 dealers = $54K to Indian
- Year 2: 250 dealers = $134K to Indian  
- Year 3: 300+ dealers = $161K+ to Indian
- Long-term: Potential $500K+/year as platform grows

## Alternative Models
1. **Revenue Share**: 15% (proposed)
2. **Equity Stake**: 5-10% of RideWire
3. **Licensing Fee**: $500/dealer/year
4. **Hybrid**: Smaller revenue % + equity

## Benefits to Indian
- Passive income from technology partnership
- Aligned incentives (both benefit from growth)
- No upfront investment required
- Scalable with network expansion
