## Post-Test 1 Analysis Framework

### Calculate Success Score

**Formula:**
```
Success Score = (Technical Performance × 0.3) + 
                (Engagement × 0.3) + 
                (Business Outcome × 0.4)

Where:
- Technical Performance = (Query Success Rate × 0.5) + (System Uptime × 0.5)
- Engagement = (Questions Asked / 10) + (Interest Rating / 10)
- Business Outcome = Test 2 Scheduled (1.0) or Not (0.0) + (Pilot Discussed × 0.5)
```

**Success Score Interpretation:**
- **0.0-0.4:** Test 1 failed - Major pivots needed
- **0.5-0.6:** Test 1 marginal - Address concerns before Test 2
- **0.7-0.8:** Test 1 successful - Proceed to Test 2 as planned
- **0.9-1.0:** Test 1 exceptional - Accelerate partnership discussions
