## 💎 PHASE 3: Viral Growth (Week 9-16)

### 3.1 Viral Content Formula

**The Hook-Insight-CTA Framework:**

```
[HOOK] - First sentence must stop the scroll
↓
[STORY/DATA] - 3-5 sentences of value
↓
[INSIGHT] - The "aha" moment
↓
[CTA] - Clear next step (follow, share, click)
```

**Example:**
```
I turned down a $50M acquisition offer last week. [HOOK]

Here's why:

RideWire is solving a $12.5B problem.
We're at $500K ARR with 100K users.
Our trajectory points to $180M ARR in 3 years. [STORY]

A $50M exit would leave $11.95B on the table. [INSIGHT]

Sometimes the best decision is to keep building.

Follow @YourHandle for more startup lessons. [CTA]
```

### 3.2 Viral Triggers (Psychological Levers)

**✅ Curiosity Gap:** "The one metric that predicts startup success (and it's not revenue)"
