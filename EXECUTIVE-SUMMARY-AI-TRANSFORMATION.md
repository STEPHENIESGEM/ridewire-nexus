## 🔗 HOW AI AGENTS COLLABORATE (No Humans)

### AI-to-AI Prompting:
```javascript
// Sales agent needs marketing content
await aiCrew.agentPrompt({
  from: 'sales',
  to: 'marketing',
  message: 'Create automotive case study for lead #12345'
});
// Marketing agent generates it in 30 seconds
```

### Autonomous Task Assignment:
```javascript
// Product agent specs feature → Engineering agent builds it
await aiCrew.assignTask({
  agent: 'engineering',
  task: 'Build Stripe payment API integration',
  deadline: '2 hours'
});
// Deployed automatically, no human involved
```

### Daily Standup (AI-to-AI):
```javascript
// All 7 agents sync every 24 hours
await aiCrew.dailyStandup();
// Returns: tasks completed, in-progress work, blockers
// No human meeting needed
```
