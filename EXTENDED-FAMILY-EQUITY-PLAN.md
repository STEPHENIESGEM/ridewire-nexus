## ✅ How Gifts Are Decided

### Stephanie's Decision Process:

After 6-12 months, Stephanie reviews:

1. **Tracy's Weekly Sign-Offs** - Did they complete their rotating chores?
2. **Overall Behavior** - Were they good roommates?
3. **Respect Level** - Did they treat everyone well?
4. **Contribution** - Did they help or hinder?

**Good Roommate = Get Gift**
- 40+ weeks of ✅ from Tracy
- Respectful, helpful, clean
- Stephanie decides: "They deserve this"
- **Result:** Full gift amount at exit

**Bad Roommate = No Gift**
- Many ❌ from Tracy
- Messy, disrespectful, took advantage
- Stephanie decides: "They don't deserve this"
- **Result:** $0, gift revoked

**Example:**
- Nicole: 48/52 weeks ✅ → Gets full $9.12M gift ✅
- Rachelle: 15/52 weeks ✅, 25/52 weeks ❌ → Gets $0 ❌

## 🔄 Rotating Chore System

**All 7 extended family members participate in rotating chores:**

- Weekly rotation through 7 core chores
- Gender-neutral (everyone does everything)
- Tracy signs off each Sunday
- Pattern of ✅ vs ❌ informs Stephanie's gift decision

**Chores:** Kitchen, Bathrooms, Yard Work, Living Areas, Laundry, Kitchen Support, Yard Support

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**This is Stephanie's generosity, not anyone's right.**

She could give:
- All 7 people nothing ($0)
- Some people something, others nothing
- Everyone the same amount
- Different amounts based on contribution

**She chose different amounts reflecting each person's impact.**

Nicole and Melissa get life-changing wealth ($9M-6M) because they earned Stephanie's gratitude through extraordinary support.

Matt, Gino, Jack get very significant money ($607K) for being solid roommates.

Russ and Rachelle get a chance to prove themselves and still walk away with $304K if they improve.

**Everyone can win. But only if they deserve it.**

## 🏁 Summary

**Total: 7 people, 5.8% equity, $35.4M after tax (at $800M exit)**

**Stephanie's gift to say:**

"You supported me when I had nothing. I'm sharing my success with you not because you earned it, but because I'm grateful and generous. Be a good roommate, and when RideWire succeeds, you'll be taken care of."

**That's the deal. Take it or leave it.**

✅ Be a good roommate → Get hundreds of thousands to millions
❌ Be a bad roommate → Get nothing

**Simple. Fair. Generous. Stephanie's choice.**
