## 🚨 Top 3 Critical Concerns

### 1. ⚠️ 4-Hour Timeline Unrealistic for Full Features
**Issue**: Full Coin App requires 40+ hours development  
**Solution**: Launch MVP (Stripe only) in 4 hours, iterate in phases

### 2. ⚠️ Untested AI Consensus for Payments
**Issue**: AI fraud detection has no training data  
**Solution**: Defer to Phase 2, use Stripe's built-in fraud detection

### 3. ⚠️ Crypto Licensing Complex
**Issue**: Money transmitter license requires 6-18 months  
**Solution**: Use licensed third-party (Coinbase Commerce) in Phase 3
