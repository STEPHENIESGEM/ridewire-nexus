# Founder Compensation Plan

## Executive Summary

As the founder of RideWire AI Hub, your compensation comes from three sources: salary, equity, and dividends. This document outlines realistic expectations for each phase of the company's growth.

---

## Phase 1: Bootstrap (Months 1-6)

### Salary: $0/month
**Why?** Preserve cash runway for infrastructure, marketing, and AI API costs.

### Equity: 100% ownership
- You own all shares initially
- This is worth $0 today but becomes valuable at exit

### Revenue Split (if bootstrapped):
- **Platform keeps:** 30% of marketplace sales
- **Sellers get:** 70% of sales
- **You get:** The 30% platform fee as cash flow

### Example (Month 3):
- Total marketplace sales: $5,000
- Platform revenue (30%): $1,500
- Your take-home: $1,500/month (after $500 costs = $1,000)

### When You Start Getting Paid:
- **Week 4:** First $100-500 from Gumroad sales (immediately available)
- **Month 3:** $1,000-2,000/month cash flow from marketplace
- **Month 6:** $3,000-5,000/month sustainable income

---

## Phase 2: Angel/Seed Round (Months 6-12)

### Salary: $5,000-8,000/month ($60K-96K/year)
**When?** After raising $500K-1M in funding

### Equity Dilution:
- You give up: 15-25% to investors
- You retain: 75-85% (still worth more in absolute terms)
- Example: If you raise at $5M valuation, your 80% = $4M on paper

### Board Approval:
Investors typically approve "market rate" founder salary:
- Solo founder: $80K-120K/year
- With co-founder: $100K-150K/year each

### Cash Flow from Business:
- Marketplace revenue: $10K-25K/month
- Platform keeps 30% = $3K-7.5K/month
- This goes to company operations (your salary comes from this)

---

## Phase 3: Series A (Year 2-3)

### Salary: $150,000-200,000/year
**When?** After raising $10M+ at $50M+ valuation

### Equity:
- You now own: 50-65% (diluted from investors)
- Paper value: $25M-32.5M (50-65% of $50M)
- **Not liquid yet** - can't sell until exit

### Options:
- Take lower salary ($120K) + more equity
- Take higher salary ($200K) + slightly less equity
- Most founders optimize for equity at this stage

---

## Phase 4: Series B+ (Year 3-5)

### Salary: $200,000-300,000/year
**CEO market rate** for $100M+ valuation companies

### Equity:
- You own: 30-50% (diluted from Series A, B, C)
- Paper value: $30M-500M (depending on valuation)

### Secondary Sales (Finally Liquid!):
- Investors may allow you to sell 5-10% of your shares
- Example: Sell 5% at $200M valuation = $10M cash in your pocket
- **This is the first time you get life-changing money**

---

## Phase 5: Exit (Year 5-10)

### Acquisition or IPO:
- **Acquisition:** Company sells for $500M-1B
  - Your 40% stake = $200M-400M cash
  - After taxes (long-term capital gains ~23.8% total) = $152M-304M take-home

- **IPO:** Company goes public at $1B+ valuation
  - Your 35% stake = $350M+
  - You can sell 10-25% per year (lockup rules)
  - Year 1 after IPO: Sell 10% = $35M cash (after taxes = $26.7M)

### Salary Expectations:

### Why Low Salaries Early?
Investors want to see:
1. **Skin in the game:** You're betting on equity, not salary
2. **Capital efficiency:** Every dollar not spent on salary = more runway
3. **Alignment:** You win when investors win (at exit)

---

## Founder Tax Strategy

### Salary (Ordinary Income):
- Taxed at 35-37% federal + 5-10% state = ~40-47% total
- $150K salary = $79K-90K after tax

### Equity (Long-Term Capital Gains):
- Held >1 year: Taxed at 20% federal + 3.8% net investment tax = 23.8%
- $10M gain = $7.62M after tax

### Optimize for Equity:
- Take minimum salary to survive
- Maximize equity ownership
- Hold shares >1 year before selling
- Save 50% on taxes vs. salary

---

## Your Personal Runway

### Before Funding:
**How long can you survive on $0 salary?**
- Savings: $X
- Monthly burn: $Y
- Runway: X/Y months

**Example:**
- Savings: $20K
- Monthly expenses: $2K

- Need revenue or funding by Month 10

### Options to Extend Runway:
1. Part-time consulting ($2K-5K/month) while building

## Founder Advice

### Don't Optimize for Salary:
- Every $10K salary increase = $200K-500K less equity value at exit
- Would you rather have $120K salary or $10M more at exit?

### Live Lean Early:
- Move back with parents (no shame - save $2K/month)
- Do consulting 10 hours/week ($2K-4K/month)
- Delay Series A by 6 months if revenue is growing

### Optimize for Equity:
- Own 60%+ at Series A ($30M+ on paper)
- Own 40%+ at exit ($200M+ cash)
- This is how billionaires are made

---

## Questions to Ask Investors

Before accepting funding:
1. "What founder salary do you approve?" (Should be $80K-150K)
2. "Can I do a small secondary sale at Series B?" (Test their flexibility)
3. "What ownership % should I target at exit?" (Good investors say 25-40%)
