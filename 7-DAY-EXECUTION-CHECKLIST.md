## 🚨 Contingency Plans

### If Upwork is slow:

- Lower gig prices to $250 (get 4 clients instead of 2)
- Offer free trials (get testimonials, then upsell)

### If Gumroad sales stall:
- Run Facebook ads ($50 budget, 1:5 ROI = $250 return)
- Post in 20 groups instead of 5
- Create bundles (5 diagrams for $39.99)

### If YouTube doesn't monetize:
- Focus on affiliates (easier, faster payouts)
- Do sponsored posts (reach out to tool companies)
- Sell shoutouts ($50-100 each)

### If you're at $1,500 on Day 7:
- Emergency freelance: TaskRabbit (make $500 in 1 day)
