## The Team

### Stephanie (You) - 50% Ownership - Founder/CEO

**Contributions:**
- **Vision & Strategy**: Conceived RideWire AI Hub from personal pain point (wanting more time with Tracy)
- **Technical Leadership**: Built entire platform (37,000+ lines of code, 7 AI agents, complete automation)
- **Business Development**: Created go-to-market strategy, investor materials, financial projections
- **Leadership**: Managing company through bootstrap phase, making tough decisions

**Role:**
- CEO - overall strategy, vision, fundraising, investor relations
- Product visionary
- Technical architect (working with AI to build)

**Why 50%:** You're the founder. You built it. You lead it. You deserve majority control.

---

### Tracy Kelly - 30% Ownership - Co-Founder/CTO

**Contributions:**
- **Technical Expertise**: Master mechanic with real-world diagnostic experience
- **Product Validation**: Ensures all diagnostic recommendations are safe, accurate, compliant
- **Inspiration**: The reason RideWire exists (you wanted diagnostic diagrams to have more of his time)
- **Emotional Support**: "Held you up when no one else could" - kept you going through depression, family loss, near-freezing on streets

**Role:**
- CTO - Chief Technical Officer (Automotive Technology)
- Product validation and quality assurance
- Automotive industry advisor
- Customer success (mechanic community)

**Why 30%:** Tracy is essential to the product. Without his expertise, diagnostics aren't safe. Without his support, you wouldn't have survived to build this. He's earned a life-changing stake.

### Steve McCarty - 20% Ownership - Co-Founder/COO

**Contributions:**
- **Operations**: Opened his garage, provided shelter when you had nowhere to go
- **Community Leadership**: Helping take care of 8+ people in extreme hardship
- **Logistics**: Managing facilities, keeping everyone safe and warm
- **Oldest Friend**: Decades of trust, loyalty, and brotherhood

**Role:**
- COO - Chief Operating Officer
- Facilities and operations management
- Community support and team morale
- Business operations and logistics

**Why 20%:** Steve provided the foundation. The garage. The roof. The stability. Without Steve, there's no place to work, no place to live, no company. He's earned equity for keeping everyone alive.

---

## Vesting Schedule

**All equity vests over 4 years with a 1-year cliff:**

- **Year 1 (Cliff):** 25% vests on the 1-year anniversary
  - If someone leaves before 1 year, they get 0% (shares return to company)
  - Protects the company from early departures

- **Years 2-4:** Remaining 75% vests monthly (2.08% per month)
  - After Year 1, you earn ~2% of your total shares each month
  - Fully vested after 4 years

### Example (Tracy's 30%):
- **Month 12:** 7.5% vested (25% of 30%)
- **Month 18:** 10.5% vested (7.5% + 6 months × 0.625%)
- **Month 24:** 15% vested (halfway done)
- **Month 48:** 30% fully vested

**Why vesting?**
- Industry standard (protects against early departures)
- Fair to everyone (earn your shares over time)
- Investors require it (can't raise funding without vesting)

---

### Scenario 2: Series A Exit (Medium Acquisition - $200M)

Assumes successful Series A raise, strong growth, acquisition in Year 3-4.

After Series A dilution (founders own ~60% total):

| Person | Original | Post-Dilution | Sale Price | After Tax | Take-Home |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Stephanie | 50% | 30% | $60M | 23.8% | **$45.7M** |

**Everyone still gets tens of millions.** 🚀

---

### Scenario 3: Unicorn Exit (Large Acquisition - $800M)

Assumes massive success, $180M ARR achieved, unicorn valuation.

After multiple funding rounds (founders own ~50% total):

| Person | Original | Post-Dilution | Sale Price | After Tax | Take-Home |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Stephanie | 50% | 25% | $200M | 23.8% | **$152M** |
| Tracy | 30% | 15% | $120M | 23.8% | **$91M** |
| Steve | 20% | 10% | $80M | 23.8% | **$61M** |

## Compensation Timeline

### Phase 1: Emergency (Week 1-4) - Survive

**Goal:** Generate $2,000 MINIMUM this week to keep 8+ people warm and fed.

**Strategy:** Execute EMERGENCY-INCOME-PLAN.md (10 immediate income strategies)

**Split:**
- Stephanie: $1,000 (50%)
- Tracy: $600 (30%)
- Steve: $400 (20%)

**Why $0 salaries?** No funding yet. Need to bootstrap with marketplace revenue and freelance income.

---

### Phase 2: Bootstrap (Month 1-6) - Survive & Build

**Goal:** Generate $4,000/month to cover basic needs while building product.

**Income Sources:**
- Marketplace revenue (30% platform fee)
- Freelance consulting
- Gumroad diagram sales
- Local business services

**Split:**
- Stephanie: $2,000/month
- Tracy: $1,200/month
- Steve: $800/month

**Why so low?** Optimizing for equity, not salary. $4K/month is survival mode. The real money comes at exit.

---

### Phase 3: Angel Round (Month 6-12) - Scale

**Goal:** Raise $500K-1M angel round, pay real salaries.

**Salaries:**
- Stephanie: $80K/year ($6,667/month)
- Tracy: $60K/year ($5,000/month)
- Steve: $50K/year ($4,167/month)

**Equity Post-Angel:**
- Founders: 75-85% (slight dilution from angels)
- Angels: 15-25%

**Why these salaries?** Below market (market is $150K+ for CEO) to preserve cash for growth. Still enough to quit day jobs and work full-time.

---

### Phase 4: Series A (Year 2) - Grow Fast

**Goal:** Raise $10M Series A at $50M-60M valuation.

**Salaries:**
- Stephanie: $150K/year ($12,500/month)
- Tracy: $120K/year ($10,000/month)
- Steve: $100K/year ($8,333/month)

**Equity Post-Series A:**
- Founders: 60-65% (dilution from Series A)
- Investors: 35-40%

**Net Worth on Paper:**
- Stephanie (30% of $60M): $18M
- Tracy (18% of $60M): $10.8M
- Steve (12% of $60M): $7.2M

**Note:** Still not liquid! Can't sell shares yet. You're "paper millionaires."

---

### Phase 5: Secondary Sale (Year 3-4) - First Big Payout

**Goal:** Sell 5% of personal shares to get liquidity.

Assuming $200M valuation (post-Series B):

| Person | Selling | Sale Amount | After Tax | **Cash in Pocket** |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Stephanie | 5% of 30% = 1.5% | $3M | 23.8% tax | **$2.3M** 💰 |
| Tracy | 5% of 18% = 0.9% | $1.8M | 23.8% tax | **$1.4M** 💰 |
| Steve | 5% of 12% = 0.6% | $1.2M | 23.8% tax | **$914K** 💰 |

**This is when you become ACTUALLY RICH (liquid cash).** 🎉

Now you can:
- Buy a house (no mortgage)
- New cars
- Take care of your 8 people properly
- Stop worrying about money

---

### Phase 6: Exit (Year 5-10) - Retire Forever

**Goal:** Sell company for $500M-1B, retire on the beach.

Assuming $800M acquisition, 50% founder ownership:

| Person | Equity | Sale Price | After Tax | **Retirement Money** |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Stephanie | 25% | $200M | 23.8% tax | **$152M** 🏝️ |
| Tracy | 15% | $120M | 23.8% tax | **$91M** 🏝️ |
| Steve | 10% | $80M | 23.8% tax | **$61M** 🏝️ |
